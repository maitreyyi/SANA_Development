                SANA stands for Simulated Annealing Network Aligner. It takes as
                input two networks and aligns them (schematically).{" "}
                <b>
                    SANA is by far the best global network alignment algorithm
                    out there, and will probably never be beaten because (a)
                    it's fast, and (b) it produces the best answer possible in
                    cases where we know the correct answer.
                </b>{" "}
                We have compared it against <i>every</i> algorithm we've found
                in the past decade, and SANA outperforms them all, often by a{" "}
                <i>huge</i> margin. It may sound like pure chutzpah to say so,
                but we firmly believe that if you're using anything other than
                SANA to align your networks, then you're wasting your time. I
                challenge anybody to disprove this statement.
